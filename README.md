### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

- Set optimal layout depending on device's screen size;
- Style hover states for interactive elements.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```CSS
.img-container:hover .overlay-img {
  opacity: 1;
}
```
```CSS
.card-title:hover{
  cursor: pointer;
  color: #00fff7;
}
```

### Continued development

Still improving my CSS knowledge and already learning Java Script.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/card/) - Bootstrap cards.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing documentation source for HTML, CSS and Java Script.
